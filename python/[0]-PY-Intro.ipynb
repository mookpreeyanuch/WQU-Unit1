We will be taking a deep dive into Data Science over the next few months.  This course will be divided into two parts, the first component will cover basic Python and programming while the second component will cover material in Data Science ranging from basic programming to data cleaning and aggregation.  The basic syllabus is as follows\n","\n","|Week|Material|\n","|---|---|\n","|1| Programming and Python fundamentals|\n","|2| Data structures|\n","|3| Algorithms, object-oriented programming, & Pythonic style|\n","|4| Reading and writing data|\n","|5| Python data science packages|\n","|6| SQL|\n","|7| Data munging|\n","|8| Object-relation mapping|\n","\n","The second component is a series of miniprojects which will test your mastery of the lecture subjects.  Data Science is not a spectator sport, so its important to practice, the miniprojects are a great way to do that.  There will be a series of five miniprojects which will need to be completed by the end of the course.\n","\n","There is an online discussion board where we can help each other learn, share code snippets, and ask questions.
